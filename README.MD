**Overview:**

Smartwatches are popular among fitness enthusiasts and analyzing the collected data is a healthcare application of Data Science.

**Target:**

Analyze physical activity data obtained from a smartwatch.

**DataSet information:**

The dataset we are using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?select=Fitabase+Data+4.12.16-5.12.16).

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch. 

**Attribute Information:**

* **Id:** unique ID
* **ActivityDate:** Date of activity.
* **TotalSteps:** Total steps walked in a day.
* **TotalDistance:** Total distance walked in a day
* **TrackerDistance:** Total distance covered during a specific activity or workout session, often recorded.
* **LoggedActivitiesDistance:** Cumulative distance covered during specific logged or recorded activities.
* **VeryActiveDistance:** Distance covered during periods of intense physical activity or high-intensity workouts.
* **ModeratelyActiveDistance:** Distance covered during periods of moderate physical activity.
* **LightActiveDistance:** Distance covered during periods of light physical activity.
* **SedentaryActiveDistance:** No cumulative distance, activities involving a low level of physical movement or inactivity.
* **VeryActiveMinutes:** Number of minutes spent engaged in high-intensity or vigorous physical activity. 
* **FairlyActiveMinutes:** Number of minutes spent engaged in moderate-intensity or moderately active physical activity. 
* **LightlyActiveMinutes:** Nmber of minutes spent engaged in light physical activity or low-intensity activities.
* **SedentaryMinutes:** Number of minutes spent in a sedentary or inactive state.
* **Calories:** number of calories burned in a day.

## Data Visualization:

**Relationship between Calories & Total Steps**

![alt text](https://github.com/Cristhian-Ninanya/smartwatch_fitness_analysis/blob/main/Images/cal_steps.png?raw=true)

**OBS:**
* There is a linear relationship between the total number of steps (TotalSteps) and the number of calories burned in a day (Calories).
* The more Very Active Minutes (VeryActiveMinutes), the more calories burned in a day (Calories).


**Average Total Active Minutes**

![alt text](https://github.com/Cristhian-Ninanya/smartwatch_fitness_analysis/blob/main/Images/activity_min.png?raw=true)

**OBS:**

* From previous chart, on an average day:
    1. 1.74% of **very active minutes** (21.16 minutes).
    2. 1.11% of **Fairly active minutes** (13.56 minutes).
    3. 15.82% of **Lightly active minutes** (192.81 minutes).
    4. 81.33% of **Total inactive minutes** (991.21 minutes).


**Average Active Minutes daily:**

![alt text](https://github.com/Cristhian-Ninanya/smartwatch_fitness_analysis/blob/main/Images/act_min_daily.png?raw=true)

**OBS**
* From previous chart, on an average day:
 1. The highest average value of "Very Active Minutes" occurs on Wednesday and Sunday, with both days reaching 23 minutes
 2. Thursday and Friday have the highest average value of "Fairly Active Minutes," both at 15 minutes.
 3. Thursday records the highest average value of "Lightly Active Minutes," totaling 207 minutes.


**Average Inactive Minutes daily:**

![alt text](https://github.com/Cristhian-Ninanya/smartwatch_fitness_analysis/blob/main/Images/inact_min_daily.png?raw=true)

**OBS:**

* From previous chart, Wednesday records the highest average value of "Inactive Minutes", with 1027.94 minutes.


**Average Calories Burned Daily:**

![alt text](https://github.com/Cristhian-Ninanya/smartwatch_fitness_analysis/blob/main/Images/calories_burned.png?raw=true)

**OBS:**

* Tuesdays exhibit high levels of activity among all individuals in the dataset, consistently showcasing the highest average calorie expenditure.


## Final Observations:

* The higher the number of Very Active Minutes (vigorous physical activity), the higher the number of calories burned in a day.

* On an average day, 1.74% of the total minutes are classified as "high activity minutes" (equivalent to 21.16 minutes).

* On an average day, 81.33% of the total minutes are classified as "Total Idle Minutes" (equivalent to 991.21 minutes).

* On average, Thursday registers the highest "active" value, while Wednesday presents the highest "inactive" value.

* Tuesdays, on average, demonstrate the highest average caloric expenditure.
